description: If you are using windows you are doing something wrong .
  Lets re-evaluate.

### Why does this blog exist -

As an ex-macOS user, I decided to give Windows a try for my new laptop since my MacBook was getting old (it was a 2017 MacBook Air). I bought a Windows gaming laptop and thought it shouldn't be THAT BAD...right?

Unfortunately, the nightmare began as soon as I started to set things up. Even before coding, I had to spend a good day or two just getting everything in place. In contrast, Linux/MacOS does everything by itself while you wait and watch.

One of the biggest issues I faced was memory management. My laptop came with 8GB pre-installed RAM, but almost all of it was taken away by bloatware and unnecessary applications that come pre-installed with Windows. These applications consume a lot of memory and resources, making it harder to run programming tasks smoothly. Additionally, background processes and updates can slow down the system and interfere with programming tasks.

Another issue I faced was the lack of a native package manager like Homebrew on macOS or APT on Linux. This makes it harder to install and manage programming tools and dependencies.

Based on my experience, I would not recommend using Windows for programming.

- `Bloatware and unnecessary applications that come pre-installed with Windows, which consume a lot of memory and resources.`

- `Background processes and updates that can slow down the system and interfere with programming tasks.`

- `Lack of a native package manager like Homebrew on macOS or APT on Linux, which makes it harder to install and manage programming tools and dependencies.`

- ` Many programming tools and software are designed to work best on macOS or Linux, so using Windows may limit access to certain tools or make it harder to use them.`

- `The security of Windows is often questioned, and new users may not have the knowledge or experience to keep their system secure, which can lead to potential risks and security breaches.`

### What actually you should consider for programming ->>

While Windows may not be the best choice for programming, there are other operating systems that are more suitable for this task. Two popular alternatives are:

## macOS <3 :

As i previously have mentioned of me being an OG MacOS user , i really like Homebrew and how easy and comfortable it made for me to code and not run into issues i didnt create . Also considering how long its battery lasts really is impressive and definately something i very highly recommed .

## Linux (Arch and Ubuntu specially) ->>

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is highly customizable and flexible , and with that it also comes with a native package manager called APT, which makes it easy to install and manage programming tools and dependencies. Although it have a steeper learning curve than macOS, it offers more control and customization options, making it a popular choice among power users and developers.

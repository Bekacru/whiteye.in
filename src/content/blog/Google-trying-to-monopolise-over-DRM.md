description: is google trying to controll the internet ?

SO , in the past there has been concern taking adblockers as we may be comming to the end of adblocker with the release of manifest V3 which is a new way of dealing with extentions inside chrome and chromium based web browser . It is claimed that the whole point of mainfest V3 vs manifest V2 is to improve the security and privacy of the browsing experience by placing limitations on what extentions can do and how it can access your data . where as in reality of how this work is that it made a lot more difficult for adblockers to do their job . But the company who is trying to do all this is a company driven by ads , you really dont have to think a whole lot of the "Security" they want to bring vs the will to scratch the bottom of the cash barrel . 


Something was recently announced called the "Web Environment Integrity" which is one of the scariest thing i have heard in my life and what it seems like it would lead to the death of the INTERNET , or the WEB as we know it . Its kinda what is said to be "Death by a thousand cuts" where all the small things here and there that google and other giants are trying to do to monopolise over the market as much as possible that when it will be done , and we look back at the internet 5 - 10 years ago , we will then realise the internet does not even resemble even a bit of what it offered [ SPECIALLY THE FREEDOM ] .

"Keeps user data and intellectual property secure" 
you already know this is going to be DRM for your web browser

you dont even have to be a programming or technological expert to understand that google controlling what works and what does not works on their browser is them taking control over AdBlockers and taking total control over your experience that you cant change .

 All this sounds like a world where you want me to use your web browser and all of your services else i wont be able to access the "free internet" as what i knew .  

## We dont wana go back to a time where certain websites and services will only be available to us if we use certain BROWSERS !

Some people from hacker news had their own take on this , this is one of which i HIGHLY AGREE on .

Someone else also had their opinion which i would like to share .
